* Changed weight menu title to “weight / style”
* Font weights and families ordered as in menu (font families per category and alphabetical) weights in ascending order -> Anyway this is just a prototype, you will be able to add, delete and set order for fonts and weights on the panel I will build for uploading.
* Toolbar displays font + weight/style name on the respective font + weight/style.
* Set colors as specimen
* Size affects only the selected text
* Fix the buy buy 'spot' position -> Since this is a special element (has to use absolute position) I have to change it's properties on font resize
* Enabled kerning
* Buy button directs user to font single page. There is no way to direct to multiple fonts since browsers only allow to open a link and max 1 pop up page (besides, this pop up page will be blocked on most browsers)
* Fixed select color wheel
* Inverting only black and white, not colors
* Allow editor size reflow (Set a max width to match your current grid)
* There is no way of detecting a 'paste' event when copying outside text on the editor. Styles will be copied into the tester from the original text. The only solution for this would be creating an 'erase' button of some kind. We could maybe also add next to it a button to create a lore ipsum maybe?
* I've added a resize trigger when text is edited so editor size will adapt to its content to avoid getting an inner scrollbar.
* Mobile -> Mobile and browsers adaptation will be done at the end since there are some integration issues that might affect it's development. I would also suggest make some slight adaptations to the mobile version in terms of UI (different toolbar set up, different color selector etc).
